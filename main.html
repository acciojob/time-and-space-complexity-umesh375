	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer, your goal should to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For Example, if a program takes an array of size a as input, the space complexity of the program become O(n).</p>
